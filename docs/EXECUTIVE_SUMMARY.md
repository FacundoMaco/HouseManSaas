## What HouseMen SaaS Is

HouseMen SaaS is a modern web app that streamlines hotel housekeeping laundry operations. It provides real-time visibility into washer and dryer cycles, reduces manual coordination, and keeps daily tasks organized in a single, simple interface.

---

## The Operational Problem

- Teams rely on walkie-talkies or in-person checks to coordinate machine availability.
- There is no shared, real-time view of active loads and cycle status.
- Time is lost to avoidable back-and-forth and rework.

---

## The Solution

- A single dashboard with live status of loads and machines
- Timers for washer and dryer cycles with clear next-step actions
- Basic task checklist to keep daily work aligned
- Mobile-first UI for tablets and phones used on-property

---

## Expected Outcomes (Pilot-Measured)

| Impact | Expected Outcome |
|--------|------------------|
| Time lost to coordination | Meaningful reduction |
| Operational visibility | Real-time status at a glance |
| Errors from guesswork | Fewer rework events |
| ROI | Measurable during the pilot |

---

## Implementation

- Setup time: 1-2 days
- Training: 2-4 hours
- Requirements: tablets/phones and internet for initial load
- Support: included during pilot

---

## Privacy and Data

- The current version stores operational data locally on the device (no server required).
- No guest personal data is stored.
- Ideal for a fast, low-friction pilot.

---

## Next Steps

1. 20-30 minute executive demo
2. 14-30 day pilot in one property
