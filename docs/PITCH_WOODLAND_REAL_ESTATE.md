# HouseMen SaaS Commercial Pitch
## For Woodland Real Estate

---

## Executive Overview

HouseMen SaaS is a focused operations tool for hotel laundry and housekeeping teams. It replaces ad-hoc coordination with a shared, real-time view of washer and dryer activity, and keeps daily tasks aligned with minimal training.

---

## The Problem We Solve

- Manual coordination slows down laundry cycles and creates unnecessary delays.
- Staff lacks a shared, real-time view of machine status.
- Small errors add up to rework and avoidable wait time.

---

## The Product in One Line

A simple, mobile-first dashboard that tracks loads, cycle timers, and daily tasks for housekeeping teams.

---

## Product Highlights

- Live dashboard of active loads and machine status
- Washer and dryer timers with clear next actions
- Automatic assignment of available dryers
- Optional daily checklist for operational consistency

---

## Pilot Success Metrics

During the pilot, we will track simple, actionable indicators:

- Average cycle time (wash + dry)
- Time lost to coordination (before vs after estimate)
- Loads processed per shift
- Operational incidents (conflicts, waiting time, rework)
- Team adoption (daily usage on the device)

At the end of the pilot, we deliver a short summary with results and recommendations.

---

## Implementation and Onboarding

- Day 1: setup and configuration
- Day 2: team training and go-live
- Support available throughout the pilot

---

## Pricing Model (USD)

**Option A: Pilot + Monthly Subscription (recommended)**
- Pilot (14-30 days): $0 - $199 (depending on scope)
- Monthly per property: $199 - $499 / month

**Option B: Implementation + Maintenance**
- One-time setup: $500 - $1,500
- Monthly maintenance per property: $149 - $399 / month

**Option C: Annual License per Property**
- Annual license: $2,000 - $5,000 / year

Final pricing depends on number of properties, operational volume, and customization level.

---

## ROI and Business Value

ROI is calculable using pilot data. We focus on measurable improvements such as reduced coordination time, fewer rework events, and improved visibility during active shifts.

---

## Privacy and Data

- Operational data is stored locally on the device for the current version.
- No guest personal data is collected or stored.
- This approach supports a fast, low-friction pilot.

---

## Next Steps

1. 20-30 minute executive demo
2. 14-30 day pilot in one property
3. Review pilot results and decide on expansion
